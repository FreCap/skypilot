"""Real-Postgres layer for the reserved-fill broker tests.

Production serve-state runs on Postgres (SKYPILOT_DB_CONNECTION_URI), so the
broker SQL (dialect-switched upserts, lease CAS rowcount, prune predicate)
and the alembic migration chain must be exercised on a real PG engine, not
only sqlite. This module:

- boots a throwaway postgres:16 container once per session via
  testcontainers (skipping the whole module cleanly when docker is
  unavailable or the container cannot start);
- re-runs the FULL sqlite round-mechanics/claims/prune/lease/epoch suite
  from test_reserved_fill_broker.py against the PG engine by overriding its
  `broker_engine` fixture (the test bodies are inherited, not copied);
- runs the alembic chain exactly as serve_state.create_table does on a
  fresh database, twice (idempotency);
- races two threads through run_round_if_stale so the publish CAS and the
  PostgresLock advisory path are exercised for real.
